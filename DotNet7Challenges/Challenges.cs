    Challenge:
    Write a program that takes an integer as input and returns the sum of all the integers from 1 to that input number.

    Constraints:

    The input number can be in the range of 1 to 10^6
    Example:
    Input: 5
    Output: 15 (1+2+3+4+5 = 15)

    This problem requires you to:

    accept an input from the user
    use a loop to iterate from 1 to the input number
    perform an operation (addition) during each iteration
    output the final result
    You have to solve the problem using all the loops (for, while, do while, foreach) and recursion
